        <p> Growing up, I was a shy boy since my childhood. Everone loves me for my innocense. I enjoyed most of the time in my maternal grandparent's house. I plaeyd cricket football and lots of other sports. I enjoyed every monsoon there. Specially summer and winter that truly stole my heart. That meomries were the best of all time. I miss my teenaage life a lot.</p>

        <h2>My Adult Life</h2>
        <h3 class="orangehlight">2021 - Present | Sad part of The LIfe</h3>
        <p>Adult life is boring. Everone is busy with their study, work and job. Nobody comes to hangout beacuse of their busy lifestyle. Nobody plays at the ground. So I'm feeling the same weight of a busy and lonely life. However, I am just trying to get out of it. After completing my study I will leave this busy life and fullfill my dream.</p>
